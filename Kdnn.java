 * 
 * Compiles with
 * 
 * javac Kdnn.java
 * 
 * Runs with:
 * cat test.txt | java Kdnn input.txt
 * 
 * Where test is a txt file of just words and their vectors, seperated by new lines
 * and input is a txt file of words and their vectors seperated by new line
 * where the first line is not a word
